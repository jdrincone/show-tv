Qin Lang, who wanted to refit the K-type aircraft, refused to obey but had to obey the orders of his superiors. In Jiangcheng, Qin Lang met Feng Lei, an air force colonel who was dismissed due to an accident. Feng Lei, who was rigorous and inhumane, and Qin Lang, who was arrogant and emotional, had a great conflict in concept. The two often battled wits and courage during training. . In an accident, Feng Lei found that Qin Lang had a serious psychological shadow on the right-hand parking in the air. Feng Lei tried various methods to make Qin Lang overcome his psychological fear regardless of his previous suspicions. Neighboring countries were in turmoil, but our army went abroad to counter terrorism but encountered terrorist attacks. The plane was hit by enemy missiles. Qin Lang overcame his psychological fear and landed in a single round to save the people and the plane. In the end, Qin Lang refitted the K-type machine as he wished, and also gained love.
