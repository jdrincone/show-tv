Joining her is whisky buff Lee Gibson. After a bumpy crossing from Portstewart to Port Ellen, they travel to Kilchoman Distillery in the west of the island. The journey proves to be worth it as they sample some whiskies made using traditional methods.</p><p>Back in the kitchen, Paula adds whisky to her next two dishes. For main course, she makes a malt and whisky lacquered duck with potato pancakes and a burnt apple sauce. For dessert, she shares her recipe for clootie dumpling, a traditional Scottish dish with a scoop of whisky-infused cream.</p><p>Along the way, Paula also reveals some of the Ulster-Scots traditions associated with Hogmanay.
