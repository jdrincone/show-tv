in Ukraine, including the most colorful ones, Koliada and Malanka, combine ancient pagan and later Christian traditions. The rituals, costumes, and texts of carols vary not only between regions, but sometimes even within the same village. In Soviet times, the church, and thus all these holidays, were banned. Carolers and malanka players were detained for performing ritual songs. As a result, in most regions of Ukraine, the authentic tradition of celebration was interrupted for several decades. Today, it is gradually reviving or continuing in places where Soviet bans could not fully reach.

The first UFC event was held on November 12, 1993 at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado. The purpose of the early UFC competitions was to identify the most effective martial art in a real fight between competitors of different fighting disciplines, including boxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Sambo, wrestling, Muay Thai, karate, judo, and other styles. In subsequent competitions, fighters began adopting effective techniques from more than one discipline, which indirectly helped create an entirely separate style of fighting known as present-day mixed martial arts.</p>", "updated": 1688645590, "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1596"}, "previousepisode": {"href": "https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/2562984"}, "nextepisode": {"href": "https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/2562986"}}}}}]
