daughter of the Great General, was appointed as the Empress consort of the sickly old Emperor. Unfortunately, on the wedding day, the old Emperor passed away. Upon hearing the news that she was to be buried together with the old Emperor, Su Jinxia collapsed. Her body was then taken over by the soul of a fashion designer from modern times. This new Su Jinxia was different from the original one. She was bold and cheerful. The new Emperor spared her from the sacrificial burial as long as she was willing to marry him. So she became the Empress consort of the new Emperor. Unaware of the Emperor's true love, Su Jinxia eventually ran away from the palace. When this plump Empress consort learned that fat women were considered low in status and bullied outside, she decided to open a plus-size clothing store. Soon, the Emperor appeared to pursue his love.</p>", "updated": 1680720788, "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/66441"}, "previousepisode": {"href":
