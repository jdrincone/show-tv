The UFC has held over 300 events to date. Dana White serves as the president of the UFC while brothers Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta control the UFC's parent company, Zuffa, LLC. The first UFC event was held on November 12, 1993 at the McNichols Sports Arena in Denver, Colorado. The purpose of the early UFC competitions was to identify the most effective martial art in a real fight between competitors of different fighting disciplines, including boxing, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Sambo, wrestling, Muay Thai, karate, judo, and other styles. In subsequent competitions, fighters began adopting effective techniques from more than one discipline, which indirectly helped create an entirely separate style of fighting known as present-day mixed martial arts.</p>", "updated": 1688645590, "_links": {"self": {"href": "https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/1596"}, "previousepisode": {"href": "https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/2562984"}, "nextepisode": {"href": "https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/2562986"}}}}}]
