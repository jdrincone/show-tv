It is said that before the Huangchao rebels captured Chang'an, the mysterious organization of the government had carried out its last mission and disappeared. Almost at the same time as they disappeared, there was also the famous treasure that the rebels searched all over Chang'an but could not find. Since then, a rumor has spread in the world that there is a big secret hidden on the legendary Longquan sword. Until one day, a mysterious orphan named Li Xing Yun was rescued by the hermit Uncle Yang by chance, and worked under him to learn martial arts. A few years later, Li Xing Yun and his sister Lu Lin Xuan went down the mountain to practice martial arts. On their way, they met two friends, Ji Ru Xue and Zhang Zi Fan, and then happened to get the legendary Longquan sword.

It is said that before the Huangchao rebels captured Chang'an, the mysterious organization of the government had carried out its last mission and disappeared.
